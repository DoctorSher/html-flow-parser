Look into newline issue.

Think about regex by chance.

Think about way to generalize the different html tests so they can be "inserted" like a module.
Also, look to refactor the parsing flow.

It looks like it will eventually be a testing suite.  Say url-tester, keyword-tester, etc.

There can be javascript urls too.

Do a literature survey on black-hat seo. See if there are any techniques out there that 
people have published. Also, look for more compromised sites so I can get a large dataset.

Work out return values for the two cases in the http parsing.

I don't like that we call tcpflow instead of http_parser, even though http_parser is the 
whole point of the program.
