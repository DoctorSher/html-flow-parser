More Immediately:

Try and figure out a way to remedy calling tcpflow first.  Perhaps see if the HFP
can start tcpflow.  That is also important not just because HFP is the point, but 
the current arguments to HFP will need to hard coded into tcpflow's system call,
which is terrible.


Future stuff:

Regular expressions.

Think about way to generalize the different html tests so they can be "inserted" like a module.
Also, look to refactor the parsing flow.

It looks like it will eventually be a testing suite.  Say url-tester, keyword-tester, etc.

There can be javascript urls too.

Do a literature survey on black-hat seo. See if there are any techniques out there that 
people have published. Also, look for more compromised sites so I can get a large dataset.

Work out return values for the two cases in the http parsing.
